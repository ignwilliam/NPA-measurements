function ops = GenerateOps(io_config, level)

% generate set of operators for Alice, Bob, Eve to build the moment
% matrix for a given level of the hierarchy
% we assume that Alice's, Bob's and Eve's operators are projective measurements


% inputs:
    % io_config: input-output configuration
    %            (a cell array that specifies the number of outputs for each input for each party)
    % level: relaxation level of the hierarchy
% output:
    % ops: set of operators associated to the moment matrix

% NOTES:
% we use structures to represent the operators, the data type for each
% field is an array that represents the inputs and outputs of each party (from left to right)
    % status: indicates whether the operator is zero operator ('0'), identity operator ('I') or product of operators ('1')
    % as: the settings of Alice's operators
    % ao: the outputs of Alice's operators
    % bs: the settings of Bob's operators
    % bo: the outputs of Bob's operators   
    % cs: the settings of Eve's operators
    % co: the outputs of Eve's operators

% example 1:
    % A00 is Alice's projector corresponding to input 0 and ouput 0
    % then we have:
    % A00.status = '1'
    % A00.as = 0
    % A00.ao = 0
    % A00.bs = []
    % A00.bo = []
    % A00.cs = []
    % A00.co = []
    
% example 2:
    % A00B10 is an operator which corresponds to product of Alice's and
    % Bob's projectors when Alice's input is 0 and her ouput is 0,
    % while Bob's input is 1 and his output is 0,
    % then we have:
    % A00B10.status = '1'
    % A00B10.as = 0
    % A00B10.ao = 0
    % A00B10.bs = 1
    % A00B10.bo = 0
    % A00B10.cs = []
    % A00B10.co = []

% example 3:
    % A00A10 is an operator which corresponds to product of two of Alice's
    % projectors: A00 * A10 (the first projector corresponds to when her
    % input is 0 and output is 0, while the second projector is when her
    % input is 1 and output is 0)
    % then we have:
    % A00A10.status = '1'
    % A00A10.as = [0,1]
    % A00A10.ao = [0,0]
    % A00A10.bs = []
    % A00A10.bo = []
    % A00A10.cs = []
    % A00A10.co = []
